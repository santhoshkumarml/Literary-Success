Predicting Literary Success using Stylometry
=============================================

Predicting the success of literary works is a curious question among publishers and aspiring writers. We examine the quantitative connection, between writing style and successful literature. Based on novels over several different genres, we probe the predictive power of statistical stylometry in discriminating successful literary works, and identify
characteristic stylistic elements that are more prominent in successful writings.

The Baseline System is implementation of the publication ["Success with Style: Using Writing Style to Predict the Success of Novels"](https://aclweb.org/anthology/D/D13/D13-1181.pdf) by [Choi, et.al.]

We extend our work from the previous known methods to classify successful novels with less successful counterparts by introducing deep syntactic elements  and the concept of ambiguity in the language as extra features.
